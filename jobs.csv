Engineer - Principal Engineer (Gas System Infrastructure/ GSD),Energy Market Authority (EMA),Singapore,2024-10-10,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3995209751/,"Singapore is embarking on an energy transition towards a more sustainable and low-carbon energy future. Decarbonising the power sector will be achieved by leveraging on natural gas as the dominant transition fuel while also increasing the use of solar, electricity imports, and low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen over the next few decades.
This will require us to plan and develop the natural gas infrastructure to continue meeting our growing needs, while we develop new hydrogen infrastructure for low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, which can enable the transition over time.
As a member of the Gas System Department, you will be part of the dynamic team responsible for overseeing the planning and development of Singapore’s gas infrastructure over the medium and long-term horizon for both natural gas and hydrogen. You will work with many stakeholders – such as other Government agencies, infrastructure operators, gas importers, and end-users – to ensure the safety and reliability of gas supply in Singapore, and facilitate the introduction of low-carbon alternatives. This will entail understanding the gas system’s impact on power operations, evaluating trade-offs of different decarbonisation pathways, and deconflicting resource requirements with other initiatives.
Together with the team, you will:
- Plan and develop additional natural gas infrastructure (e.g. new LNG import facilities, network facilities) needed to meet gas demand. This includes overseeing the new LNG terminal project, and reviewing the existing system to ensure its continued efficiency, reliability, and stability;
- Work with developers and consultants on technical feasibility studies, front-end engineering & design, etc. leading up to Final Investment Decision for the needed gas system infrastructures.
- Shape the energy infrastructure masterplan to guide Singapore’s energy transition, considering the feasibility and trade-offs of different approaches. This includes the phasing of new infrastructure such as import terminals and pipelines;
- Establish operating parameters and policy/regulatory frameworks for the new hydrogen infrastructure, considering feasibility, safety, reliability, security and costs;
- Advance understanding of new gas technology/equipment, and assess their suitability for Singapore;
- Support engagements with other agencies to secure land and pipeline corridors to enable the deployment of both natural gas and hydrogen infrastructures; and
Job Requirements:
- Be proactive and curious towards learning and problem solving.
- Exhibit strong analytical and critical thinking skills, to be able to distil complex information, assess trade-offs, and propose practical solutions.
- Have good communication skills – concise and coherent.
- Possess strong interpersonal skills, to work well with a range of stakeholders both within and beyond the public service and understand their different perspectives.
- Be driven and resourceful, whether working independently or as part of a team.

"Software Engineer, New Grad",Stripe,"Singapore, Singapore",2024-10-05,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4008209637/,"Who we are
About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
About The Team
Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
What you’ll do
As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.
Responsibilities
- Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
- Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
- Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
- Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills
Who you are
We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
Minimum Requirements
- A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
- Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
- Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
- Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
Preferred Qualifications
- One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
- Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
- Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases
Hybrid work at Stripe
Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.
Pay and benefits
The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is S$85,700 - S$128,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
