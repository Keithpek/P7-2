To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

What you'll do
- Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
- Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
- Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
- Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure

- Follow agile software development practices
- Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
- Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
- Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events
Who you are
- You love technology and working with brilliant people
- You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
- You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
- You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
- You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
- You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
- You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
- You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software
